# Dodge-to-survive
Funny minigame about dodge evil balls. Created to test the ragdoll for my future UniVersor game (https://github.com/MB3001/UniVersor-ERE).

You can play it by clicking "MyGame.jar" in "dist" folder.

You can move the camera with 'ASDW' and the rag doll with 'IJLM'. Wiht 'K' you can jump and with 'U' you can fly. You close the program with "Esc" key. 

It is built with JMonkeyEngine (http://jmonkeyengine.org/).
